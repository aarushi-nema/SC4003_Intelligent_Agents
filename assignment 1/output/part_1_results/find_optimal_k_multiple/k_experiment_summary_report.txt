K-Value Experiment for Policy Iteration (10 runs per K value)
==================================================

For K=25
# of iterations = 4 to 10
Average utility = 83.47 to 93.04
Maximum Utility = 90.33 to 99.96
Time to converge: 0.16 to 0.40 seconds

For K=50
# of iterations = 4 to 9
Average utility = 86.92 to 92.92
Maximum Utility = 93.78 to 99.85
Time to converge: 0.16 to 0.37 seconds

For K=75
# of iterations = 6 to 8
Average utility = 91.29 to 92.99
Maximum Utility = 98.22 to 99.91
Time to converge: 0.24 to 0.33 seconds

For K=100
# of iterations = 6 to 8
Average utility = 91.67 to 92.90
Maximum Utility = 98.60 to 99.78
Time to converge: 0.24 to 0.34 seconds

For K=125
# of iterations = 5 to 7
Average utility = 90.41 to 92.47
Maximum Utility = 97.33 to 99.40
Time to converge: 0.20 to 0.29 seconds
